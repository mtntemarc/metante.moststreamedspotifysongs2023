# Exploratory Data Analysis on the Most Streamed Spotify 2023 Dataset

# I. INTRODUCTION
This task involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Spotifyâ€™s most-streamed songs in 2023 to uncover patterns and insights into track popularity. The process starts by reviewing the dataset for missing values and data types, followed by summary statistics highlighting metrics like stream counts and musical attributes (e.g., BPM, danceability). Visualizations, such as bar charts and scatter plots, will identify trends, while correlations between streams and features like tempo and energy will provide insights into factors driving popularity. Findings will be summarized with recommendations to clarify what makes a track successful on Spotify in 2023.

In this project, I took a step-by-step approach to explore and analyze the dataset, ensuring each part of the process was thorough and clear. I started by outlining key questions to focus on the most relevant insights. From there, I followed a detailed coding process to clean, visualize, and examine the data carefully. By the end, I could draw out some interesting trends and patterns, bringing out insights from the results. This method helped me break down the analysis in a structured way.
